\section{Project Description (Milestone Requirement)}
This section addresses items (a)--(e) of the milestone description. It establishes functional understanding prior to detailed CAD work.

\subsection{(a) Functional Overview}
The \textbf{Metro Sliding Doors} system provides controlled passenger access between the platform and the train interior using a simplified three-actuator pneumatic architecture:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{Door Actuator Cylinder (DC)}: a single long-stroke pneumatic cylinder (approx. 850 mm stroke) driving both door leaves via a dual rack / single pinion mechanism. \textit{Extended = Doors Open}, \textit{Retracted = Doors Closed}.
	\item \textbf{Lock Linear Solenoid (LS)}: a compact linear actuator (approx. 100 mm stroke) providing mechanical locking. Sequence: it actuates (extends) briefly to disengage the lock prior to door motion, then returns (retracts) to a neutral standby while the door completes travel; re-engagement occurs after verified closure.
	\item \textbf{Metro Slider Cylinder (MSC)}: an auxiliary medium-stroke cylinder (approx. 425 mm stroke) that deploys a secondary sliding element/cover concurrently with door opening and retracts during door closing. \textit{Extended = Slider Open}, \textit{Retracted = Slider Closed}.
\end{enumerate}
	\textbf{Sensors and Safety Logic:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{Reed switches} on the door actuator confirm fully open and fully closed positions (end-of-stroke). Optional mid-travel can be added later.
	\item \textbf{IR Beam (Door-to-Door)}: verifies unobstructed closure. If the beam is broken during a closing sequence, the system immediately commands a reopen (DC extend, MSC extend) while keeping the lock solenoid disengaged to avoid pinch hazards.
	\item Status indicators (Red = Locked/Inactive, Green = Active/Unlocked) reflect system readiness.
	\item Interlocks ensure the door cannot begin opening unless the lock solenoid has completed its unlock pulse.
\end{itemize}
Core functions:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Provide smooth synchronized bi-directional sliding using one primary actuator.
	\item Enforce lock-before-motion safety and obstruction detection auto-reopen.
	\item Present clear status via indicators and sensor-driven logic.
	\item Support emergency stop: system vents; doors hold or reopen per fail-safe policy (final choice: \textit{fail-safe open on obstruction while closing}).
	\item Simplify maintenance by reducing actuator count (one main door cylinder instead of two).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{(b) Workpiece Description}
The \textbf{workpiece} is the \emph{passenger passage aperture} governed by two coupled sliding leaves.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Clear opening width (aperture): \textit{TODO (e.g., 1400 mm)}
	\item Each leaf nominal coverage: half aperture + overlap allowance (seal) \textit{(compute after selecting frame profile)}
	\item Door leaf height: \textit{TODO (e.g., 2000 mm)}
	\item Door actuator stroke: \textbf{$\approx$ 850 mm} (matches travel needed for full open)
	\item Metro slider stroke: \textbf{$\approx$ 425 mm} (about half of main door travel)
	\item Lock solenoid stroke: \textbf{$\approx$ 100 mm} (sufficient for pawl withdrawal)
	\item Construction: Aluminum perimeter frame + tempered glass insert (light neutral tint) \textit{(confirm thickness, e.g., 6--8 mm)}
\end{itemize}
Color coding draft: Frame (RAL 9006), glass (clear), safety / edge trim (high-visibility yellow). Final selection pending ergonomic review.\newline
	extbf{NOTE:} Insert detailed elevation with stroke annotation and rack/pinion centerline.\\
\fbox{\parbox{0.9\linewidth}{Dimensional Drawing Placeholder (Front Elevation + Stroke Marks) -- TODO}}

\subsection{(c) Operating Sequence}
High-level sequence (mapping: DC Extended = Doors Open, MSC Extended = Slider Open, LS Extended = Unlock Pulse):
\begin{enumerate}[label=Step \arabic*:,leftmargin=2.2cm]
	\item \textbf{Idle Locked}: System inactive. DC Retracted (doors closed), MSC Retracted (slider closed), LS Retracted (lock engaged). Red ON.
	\item \textbf{Unlock Pulse}: Activation pressed. LS Extends briefly to withdraw lock pawl; Green ON. LS then retracts to standby (pawl held clear mechanically).
	\item \textbf{Dwell Open}: DC Extended, MSC Extended. Timer or passenger flow condition decides closing initiation.
	\item \textbf{Closing}: Close command (Master). DC Retracts; MSC Retracts. IR beam must remain clear. If IR obstruction occurs, sequence aborts and system returns to Opening (auto-reopen).
	\item \textbf{Closed + Relock}: Reed Closed confirms stroke end. IR beam \emph{clear} condition verified. LS may perform a short confirm pulse (optional) or remain retracted if passive latch design. Red or Green status per armed state policy.
\end{enumerate}
Interlocks and Safety:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Door motion blocked until initial unlock pulse complete.
	\item Obstruction (IR beam break during closing) forces immediate DC re-extend + MSC re-extend (fail-safe reopen) and inhibits relock.
	\item Emergency stop vents air: choose policy (recommended: hold position if mid-travel, else reopen if safe). To finalize after pneumatic circuit design.
	\item Closing command restricted to Master panel; Opening allowed from Master or Slave (local).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{(d) Additional Components for Full Operation}
Beyond base actuators, system integrates: \newline
	\textbf{Actuators and Motion:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item 1x Long-stroke pneumatic double-acting cylinder (dual rack door motion) with end cushioning.
  \item 1x Medium-stroke pneumatic double-acting cylinder (metro slider).
  \item 1x Short-stroke linear solenoid / pneumatic cylinder (lock).\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Valves and Air Prep:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item 3x Solenoid-operated 5/2 directional valves (one per actuator) or integrated manifold.
	\item FRL unit (Filter-Regulator-Lubricator) + main shutoff valve + pressure gauge.
	\item Quick exhaust valves (optional) for faster closing.\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Sensors:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Reed switches on door cylinder (Open/Closed) + optional mid-travel.
  \item IR beam pair across doorway (obstruction + closed verification).
  \item Reed or proximity sensor for metro slider extended/retracted (optional if correlated to door cylinder).
	\item Lock solenoid end-of-stroke confirmation (optional micro-switch). 
	\item Panel pushbuttons: Open (Master/Slave), Close (Master), Activate, Emergency Stop.
	\item Indicator lights: Green (Ready/Active), Red (Locked/Inactive).\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Mechanical Guidance:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Linear rails or roller track assemblies for door leaves.
	\item Linkage brackets coupling cylinder rod to carriage.
	\item Locking pawl and strike plate assembly.\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Safety / Enclosure:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Protective upper compartment housing cylinders and valves.
	\item Panel enclosure (added in Milestone 2) reserved space in frame design.\end{itemize}

\subsection{(e) System Understanding Emphasis}
Prior to CAD work, verify: sizing of cylinders vs required stroke (half door travel), force calculations (friction + inertia), rail selection load rating, lock mechanism sequence timing, and sensor mapping to control logic. \textbf{DO NOT} finalize 3D design until force/stroke assumptions are validated.\newline
	extbf{NOTE:} Insert preliminary engineering calculations (force, stroke, timing) here.\\

% =============================================================
\subsection*{Mechanical Actuation Mechanism}
\label{subsec:mechanism}
Transmission architecture:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \textbf{Dual Rack / Single Pinion}: Two parallel racks rigidly fixed to the respective door leaves engage a central pinion mounted on a shaft supported by bearings.
  \item \textbf{Single Door Cylinder Coupling}: The long-stroke cylinder couples to Rack A via a clevis + carriage. Extension drives Rack A forward, rotating the pinion and simultaneously translating Rack B in the opposite direction, yielding symmetric door motion.
  \item \textbf{Metro Slider Cylinder}: Independently mounted; its extension deploys the metro slider panel (auxiliary cover or secondary barrier) in synchrony with door opening for staged access. Retraction during closing maintains clearance.
  \item \textbf{Lock Linear Solenoid}: Acts on a pawl/keeper interface. A brief extension withdraws the pawl (unlock pulse). Prompt retraction minimizes exposure and readies the mechanism for re-locking upon verified closed state.
  \item \textbf{Guidance}: Each door leaf rides on a lower rail using four rollers (2 leading, 2 trailing) for load distribution and reduced friction; upper guidance optional for anti-sway.
  \item \textbf{Sensing}: Reed switches (door cylinder ends), IR beam (obstruction + closed verification), optional micro-switch on lock solenoid.
\end{itemize}
Benefits: Reduced actuator count, synchronized motion, clear sensing points, compact upper compartment packaging.

\section{SolidWorks 3D Mechanical Design Guidelines (Adapted)}
Design will mirror real hardware implementation. Key project-specific guidelines adapting milestone points:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Ground-seated frame with vertical uprights supporting upper cylinder compartment.
	\item All pneumatic hardware (valves, FRL, tubing routing) contained within or on rear of frame, not protruding into passenger path.
	\item Frame width sized by aperture + rail assemblies; height sized by door leaf + clearance + cylinder compartment depth.
	\item Reserved mounting plane for future control panel (Milestone 2) on side column.
	\item Clear delineation of stages: (Input = Unlock + Activate), (Operation = Open/Close door motion), (Delivery = Secured locked state ready for next cycle).
	\item Cylinder orientation strictly horizontal; lock cylinder orthogonal or vertical depending design choice (to finalize).
	\item Use linear guide rails for door translation; bearings for any rotating shafts (if conversion mechanism used).
	\item Support layers: base chassis, mid rail support, upper actuator compartment.
	\item Door position tracking via reed switches; optional mid-stroke sensor mount features integrated.\end{itemize}
	\textbf{NOTE:} Insert 3D views (isometric, front, side) of assembled model.\\
